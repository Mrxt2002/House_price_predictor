## Introduction

The House Price Predictor project aims to provide accurate predictions of house prices using a variety of machine learning models. This project is intended for data scientists, developers, and anyone interested in real estate price prediction.

## Features

- **Multiple Machine Learning Models:** Implementations of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize data distributions and model predictions.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to evaluate model performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for inputting house features and obtaining price predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Flask (for web deployment)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-predictor.git
cd house-price-predictor
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
3. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path data/your_dataset.csv
   ```

### Making Predictions

1. Run the prediction script:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --model_path models/your_model.pkl --input_data '{"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2, ...}'
   ```

### Web Deployment

1. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the web interface.
